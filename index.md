I build websites and applications to solve specific problems. I know the challenges local and international companies are facing right now. Want to bost sales or traffic? Lets talk.

## What you get when you work with me
<ul>
<li>A framework or backend that is simple to service, update, and interact with.</li>
<li>Preformance driven design.</li>
<li>A designer with an open mind who takes client feedback seriously.</li>
</ul>
I do not sell people things they do not need. Are you a local or small business looking to get your old site updated and working with modern devices? I specialize in small and local business and understand how tight your budget probably is right now.


## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
