  If you've ever wanted to be awesome then check out [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
  I started watching the [SICP video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) about a month ago and was surprised to find 2-5 other people who are currently active on the openstudy.com group associated with the course. A few people have even been posting and discussing exercises on github. If you're interested in SICP this is a great time to pick it up because I don't see active study groups often and it would only take a few dedicated people to make this one worth everyone's while.
