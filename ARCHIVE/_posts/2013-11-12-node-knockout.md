=============
Having entered the node knockout, and also having started a new suicide mission web project (not enough time, budget for one hacker only, existing rails codebase with 5,000+ commits, etc.), the weekend was a bit of a mad dash. This was my first NKO, or hackothon of any sort, and I was mostly interested in testing my new skills in an unfamiliar environment (node). It was a lot of fun! It was great to write everything in ClojureScript and it forced me to learn things I didn't know. Entry url: http://this-lambda-life.2013.nodeknockout.com/
